## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- pip

### Installation

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/HiteshKumar360/Medicine-Recommendation-System.git
cd Medicine-Recommendation-System

# 2. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 3. Run the application
python main.py
```

### Access

Open your browser and navigate to:
```
http://127.0.0.1:5000
```

## 📊 How It Works

```
User Input (symptoms)
        ↓
Symptom Encoding → 132-dim binary vector
        ↓
SVM Classifier → Predicts Disease
        ↓
Dataset Lookup → Fetch recommendations
        ↓
Output: Disease Info + Medications + Diet + Precautions + Workout
```

1. User enters comma-separated symptoms (e.g., `fever, headache, nausea`)
2. Symptoms are encoded into a binary feature vector matching the model's input shape
3. The trained SVM classifier predicts the most likely disease
4. Helper functions query CSV datasets to fetch matching records
5. All results are rendered dynamically on the web page
